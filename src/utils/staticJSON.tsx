      {
        question: 'Will you help to improvise my startup idea?',
        answer:
          'Our team of start-up developers will take care of every improvisation your idea needs. Before starting, we conduct a thorough check on your idea and curate a list of concepts to be added to help you reach your objectives.',

      {
        question: 'Will I own the proprietary rights?',
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: 'Can you give a fixed price quote for the MVP model?',
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: 'Will I get help post-launch?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Will I get the support to raise funds for my project?',
        answer:
          'Startup app development is a costly process. And for a startup which is looking forward to entering the mobile market needs funds to back upon. We, as a team, can guide you on how to raise funds.',
      },
      {
        question:
          'What monetisation method is appropriate for my startup idea?',
        answer:
          'There are a number of monetisation methods you can choose for your startup project. You can either have a paid one right from the launch, or you can introduce once it is in the market. You can even go for in-app payment options such as giving space to advertisements.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How will I determine the success of my startup idea?',
        answer:
          "Determining the success of your startup idea largely depends on what your analysis criteria are. For some high downloads is success and for some, it's the activity time on an app or website and for some generating revenue. What matters to you can be the way you can determine your success rate.",

        question: 'How to develop an app from scratch?',
        answer:
          'To build an app from scratch, you first need to have a thorough understanding of your app requirements. Try starting with penning down the requirements - the features you want, the platform you want to develop your app in, the app type, etc. Once your requirements are finalised, and your budget decided, partner with skilled app developers squad that understands your vision well and puts in much effort to get your dream into reality.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the app development cost in the UK?',
        answer:
          'The cost of developing an app in the UK ranges between £5000 - £1,50,000. It is mainly dependent upon what kind of app requirements you have. For example, if you want to develop a complex app, then the cost might be on the heftier side.

        question: 'How many types of mobile applications are there?',
        answer:
          'Mobile applications can be differentiated into categories, including industries, functionalities, and technologies. As per the technological aspect, the different mobile applications are native, hybrid, cross-platform, and progressive web applications.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Should my app be native or hybrid?',
        answer:
          'This largely depends on your niche and target audience. We analyse your idea carefully and suggest the most suitable app development platform. Both options have their own benefits; therefore, it is crucial to consider every aspect of the application.',
